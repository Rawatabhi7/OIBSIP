Certainly! Hereâ€™s a concise description for Java development tasks related to the number guessing game and ATM interface:

1. Number Guessing Game:
As part of the Oasis Infobyte Summer Internship Program (OIBSIP), I am working on implementing a number guessing game using Java.
The game will include the following features:

User Interaction: Players will input their guesses, and the program will provide feedback (higher, lower, or correct).
Random Number Generation: The game will generate a random number for players to guess.
Looping Logic: The game will continue until the player guesses the correct number or decides to quit.
User-Friendly Interface: I aim to create an intuitive and engaging user experience.

2. ATM Interface:
Additionally, I am tasked with designing an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface using Java. The ATM interface will include the following functionalities:
Transaction History
Cash Withdrawal
Cash Deposit
Transfer
Quit
