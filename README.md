Certainly! Hereâ€™s a concise description for Java development tasks related to the number guessing game and ATM interface:

<h1>1. Number Guessing Game:</h1>
As part of the Oasis Infobyte Summer Internship Program (OIBSIP), I am working on implementing a number guessing game using Java.
The game will include the following features:

User Interaction: Players will input their guesses, and the program will provide feedback (higher, lower, or correct).
Random Number Generation: The game will generate a random number for players to guess.
Looping Logic: The game will continue until the player guesses the correct number or decides to quit.
User-Friendly Interface: I aim to create an intuitive and engaging user experience.

<h1> 2. ATM Interface:</h1>
Additionally, I am tasked with designing an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface using Java. The ATM interface will include the following functionalities:

1. Transaction History: View the transaction history of the account.
2. Withdraw: Withdraw funds from the account.
3. Deposit: Deposit funds into the account.
4. Transfer: Transfer funds between accounts.
5. Check Balance: Check the current account balance.
6. Exit: Exit the ATM interface.
